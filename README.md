## OVERVIEW

This package fits HST/COS data on the QUEST quasars, as described in
[Veilleux et
al. 2021](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2021arXiv211200789V/abstract). It
wraps the absorption-line fitter in
[IFSFIT](https://github.com/drupke/ifsfit) to perform the fitting of
NV and OVI ultraviolet lines. It also produces the plots that appear
in this paper.
